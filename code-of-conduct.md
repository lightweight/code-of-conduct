The New Zealand Open Source Society (NZOSS) aims to foster an inclusive community which invites diverse groups of people from all backgrounds, regardless of who they are (age, body size, race, gender, gender identity and expression, sexuality, disability) or what they believe (religion/non-religion, political affiliation) to discuss and learn about Free and Open Source (FOSS) - and the broader implications, opportunities, and obligations that come with the freedom to share - in an environment of mutual respect, tolerance, and encouragement.

NZOSS organises and sponsors a diverse range of online and physical spaces including (but not limited to) an array of NZOSS mailing lists, various FOSS-related conferences, the #nzoss IRC channel, and local FOSS meetups. In order to achieve our goals, we encourage all participants to create a friendly, welcoming environment for everyone involved.

We expect participants to treat each other respectfully. Intolerance is incompatible with a tolerant group culture. As such, the NZOSS will not tolerate any intimidation, harassment, and/or any abusive, discriminatory behaviour by any participants.  The use of inappropriate, derogatory, and/or offensive content/behavior in any of these spaces is strictly prohibited. The NZOSS Council has the final decision on what is acceptable behaviour. A breach of conduct may lead to disciplinary actions, up to and including dismissal from the NZOSS related events and spaces.

If you see or hear something that makes you uncomfortable, we encourage you to make a complaint. To make a complaint:

1. Contact the organisers of the event (if applicable), or the NZ Council (council@nzoss.org.nz).
2. You may also contact any member of the Council directly (https://nzoss.org.nz/council).

If you make a complaint, the NZOSS Council will undertake to:

1. Keep your identity private, maintaining your anonymity.
2. Take your complaint seriously, investigate the incident, and take any action we deem necessary.
3. The committee may, at its discretion, publish a ‘transparency report’ to the NZOSS community (e.g. via a mailing list) that includes the nature of the complaint and what the Council decided to do about it. These reports help us inform the community of the actions the Council have taken, and will be published for transparency unless there’s a good reason not to (e.g. privacy considerations). In all cases, the offender and the complainant will be made anonymous in any such report.

The NZOSS may take any or all of the following measures:

- The offender may be told to stop/modify their behaviour appropriately and a warning will be issued.
- The offender may be asked to immediately leave the venue/space.
- The offender may be prohibited from continuing to attend any NZOSS-affiliated events.
- The incident may be reported to New Zealand Police.

NZOSS is aware of the responsibility required to ensure a successful and productive community now and in years to come, and will take appropriate measures after an incident occurs to prevent it from happening again.
